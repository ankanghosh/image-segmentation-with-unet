Image segmentation with U-Net using the Oxford-IIIT Pet dataset.
This is a Google Colab notebook to demonstrate image segmentation with U-Net using the Oxford-IIIT Pet dataset. The data is first preprocessed and an enhanced U-Net architecture is used to implement the model for the semantic segmentation of images. The model performs fairly well and achieves a test accuracy of about 91% and a Mean IoU of 0.7681, the model demonstrates strong overall segmentation capability.

# Tools Used
Tools and libraries used in this project include TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, and NumPy.

# Who can benefit from the project?
Anyone can use the project to get started with the basics of semantic image segmentation and TensorFlow.

# Getting Started
Anyone interested in getting started with Machine Learning, Deep Learning, or Computer Vision, particularly semantic image segmentation using the U-Net architecture and TensorFlow, can clone or download the project to get started.

# References
The most important point of reference for the project is TensorFlow's tutorial on image segmentation. Link [here]([https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tutorials/tf2_object_detection](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/segmentation).

# Additional Notes
1. The dataset is available [here](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/). Alternatively, the Oxford-IIIT Pet dataset is also available via [TensorFlow Datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/oxford_iiit_pet). If the dataset is taken down in the future, please feel free to reach out to me at ankanatwork@gmail.com if you would like to learn more about the data. However, I may not be able to share the dataset with you due to licensing restrictions.
2. The project is a basic one in nature and is not currently being maintained.
